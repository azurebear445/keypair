## Create foundational Azure SSH Public Key module with base resource

**Story Points:** 1
**Type:** Story

---

### Description

Create the base Azure SSH Public Key Terraform module as part of the AWS-to-Azure migration effort. This module is the Azure equivalent of the existing `terraform-aws-instance_key_pair` module.

In AWS, the module creates an EC2 key pair with a TLS-generated private key. The Azure equivalent will create an `azurerm_ssh_public_key` resource with the same TLS key generation approach.

This story covers base resource creation only. Additional features and testing will follow in subsequent stories.

**AWS Reference Module:** `terraform-aws-instance_key_pair`

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Module creates TLS private key (RSA, matching AWS default)
- [ ] Module creates `azurerm_ssh_public_key` resource
- [ ] Private key output marked as sensitive
- [ ] Tag processing logic follows approved module patterns (NSG, Storage Account)
- [ ] Variables include namespace, environment, location, resource_group_name
- [ ] Location validation restricts to approved Azure regions
- [ ] Example configuration provided in `examples/default/`
- [ ] README with module description and sensitive output instructions
- [ ] `terraform validate` passes
- [ ] Module file structure matches existing Azure module conventions

---

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Module files created: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, tags.tf, versions.tf
- [ ] Example usage provided
- [ ] README created
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Merged to main branch

---

### Out of Scope (Future Stories)

- Key rotation or expiry logic
- Integration with Azure Key Vault
- Conditional key algorithm selection (e.g., ECDSA)
- Sandbox testing and publishing

---

### Dependencies

- Access to Azure module repository
- Approved tag structure from existing modules

---

### AWS to Azure Mapping

| AWS | Azure |
|-----|-------|
| `tls_private_key` | `tls_private_key` (same) |
| `aws_key_pair` | `azurerm_ssh_public_key` |
| Key pair attached to EC2 | SSH key referenced by VM |
| VPC-scoped | Resource Group + Location scoped |



Summary:
Created example configurations and documentation for team consumption.

Changes:
- Renamed examples/default/ to examples/basic/
- Created examples/advanced/ with lifecycle and custom tags
- Updated README.md with feature comparison table (AWS vs Azure)
- Added complete variable documentation
- Added usage examples, outputs, limitations, and troubleshooting sections

Testing:
- terraform validate ✅
- terraform plan ✅
- Basic example deploys successfully in sandbox
